Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

code used:
   select count(*)
   from business
iii. Category table =records:10000 
code used:
   select count(*)
   from category
iv. Checkin table =records:10000 
code used:
   select count(*)
   from checkin
v. elite_years table =

 from category
iv. Attribute =records:1115
code used:
 select count(distinct business_id)
 from attribute
v. Review =records:10000
code used:
 select count(id)
 from review
vi. Checkin = records:493
coode used
 select count(distinct business_id) 
 from checkin
vii. Photo =records:10000
coode used
 select count(id) 
 from photo
viii. Tip =records:3979
coode used
 select count(distinct business_id)

+--------+--------------+

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans? "Yes"

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results: 
Since sqlite do not have the square and square root function. It is imparative we rely on the R^2. Besides, the correlation coefficient(R) can as well be derived by taking the the square root of the R^2. if we do this, 
R=0.66 
This means that their is a positive relation between fans and review count.This implies that posing more review correlats with more fans.
 
In other words,the R^2 which is a coefficient of determination, measures how the variation in a variable is explained by another variable and the R^2 between fans and review_count is 0.437136492915. This means that about 43.7% variation in fans is explained by review_count.This implies that posing more review correlats with more fans. 
	code used:
select avg((review_count-avg_x)*(fans-avg_y))*avg((review_count-avg_x)*(fans-avg_y))/(var_x*var_y) as R2
from user,(select 
avg_x,
avg_y,
avg((review_count-avg_x)*(review_count-avg_x)) as var_x,
avg((fans-avg_y)*(fans-avg_y)) as var_y
from user, (select 
     avg(review_count) as avg_x,
     avg(fans) as avg_y
     from user)
	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:There are more reviews with the word "love" in them

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

when text like "%love" then "yes"
when text like "love%" then "yes"
when text like "%love%" then "yes"
else "No"
end love

where love="yes"
--1780 rows was retrieved 

select text, case 
when text like "%hate" then "yes"
when text like "hate%" then "yes"
when text like "%hate%" then "yes"
else "No"
end Hate
from review
where Hate="yes"
--232 rows was retrieved
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours? Yes


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews? Yes
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain. I was not to make any inference because the sample size i got after the query was small

SQL code used for analysis: 
select 
b.name,
b.city,
c.category,
b.stars,
h.hours
from business b inner join category c on b.id=c.business_id inner join hours h on b.id=h.business_id
where city="Toronto" and category="Restaurants"
group by b.stars

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: open business tends to have more review that closed business
         
     
ii. Difference 2: open business has more rating in terms of stars than closed business
             
         
SQL code used for analysis:
select 
b.name,
b.city, 
c.category,
b.stars,
h.hours,
b.review_count, 
b.is_open
from business b inner join category c on b.id=c.business_id inner join hours h on b.id=h.business_id
group by is_open


	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:Here i want to study the relationship between number of hours a business opens  and star rating
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data: 
In this study , i will work with  the business, and hours table. 
Then i will extract name,city,stars column from the business table. i will also extract hours column from the hours table.

I this study i will be making use of quantitative data(float and integer) to compute the correlation cofficient or coefficient of determination. specifically, i will be working with the hours column(after taking the difference between the time the business opens and time the business closes) and stars column
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
----------------------+-----------+-------+-----------------------+
| name                 | city      | stars | hours                 |
